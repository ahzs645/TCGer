Here's a comprehensive app prompt for building an iOS 26 app UI Kit:

iOS 26 App UI Kit Prompt: TCGer - Trading Card Collection Manager
App Overview
Build a modern iOS 26 SwiftUI app that allows users to manage their trading card collections across multiple games (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG). The app connects to a backend API (Docker-hosted) and provides card viewing, collection management ("binders"), and card scanning capabilities.

API Integration Notes

Base URL: Configurable in settings (Docker host URL)
Endpoints Needed:

POST /auth/login & /auth/register
GET /cards/search
GET /cards/:id
POST /collections (create binder)
GET /collections (list binders)
POST /collections/:id/cards (add cards to binder)
POST /scanner/identify (upload card image for OCR/ML)


Offline: Cache recent searches and collection data in Core Data

Fallback: If confidence <80%, show manual search


This prompt provides everything needed to build a comprehensive iOS 26 trading card collection app. Would you like me to create specific SwiftUI code examples for any of these screens?RetryAJI mean can you mention the specific api we are connecting to "local host" or that ip address and the port?Searched project for “API endpoint localhost port backend server URL docker”7 results.env.docker.exampletextdocker/docker-compose.prod.ymltextdocker/README.mdtextdocker/docker-compose.ymltextbackend/src/server.tstextfrontend/.env.local.exampletextplan.md2 relevant sectionstextPerfect! Based on the project knowledge, here's the updated API connection section:

Network Configuration for iOS Simulator:

Simulator uses localhost:3000 (maps to host machine)
Add NSAppTransportSecurity exception in Info.plist for local HTTP:

xml<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsLocalNetworking</key>
    <true/>
    <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
    <dict>
        <key>localhost</key>
        <dict>
            <key>NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>

        </dict>
    </dict>
</dict>
Network Configuration for Physical Device:

User must enter their computer's local IP address in Settings
Example: http://192.168.1.100:3000
Ensure Docker backend is exposed on host network (ports are mapped in docker-compose.yml)
Both device and computer must be on same WiFi network

Authentication Flow:

User logs in → POST /auth/login
Receive JWT access token + refresh token
Store tokens in iOS Keychain
Include in all requests: Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
On 401 response, attempt POST /auth/refresh
If refresh fails, redirect to login

Settings Screen Addition:

API Configuration Section:

API Base URL (text field with validation)

Default: http://localhost:3000
Validation: Must start with http:// or https://


Test Connection button (pings /health)
Connection Status indicator (green/red dot with last check time)
Help text: "For physical devices, enter your computer's IP address (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:3000)"




This gives you the complete networking setup for the iOS app to connect to your Docker-hosted backend!
