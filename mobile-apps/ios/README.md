# iOS App Placeholder

This directory will host the native iOS client built with SwiftUI and the unified API SDK. Planned milestones:

- Xcode workspace with module targets for shared networking (SDK) and app UI.
- Authentication + collection explorer mirroring the web experience.
- Offline cache using Core Data / SQLite for recent searches.

Additional scaffolding will be added once the backend contracts are finalized.
